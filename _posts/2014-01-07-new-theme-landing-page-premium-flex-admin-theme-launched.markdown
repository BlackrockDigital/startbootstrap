Hi there Start Bootstrap users! We have some exciting updates to share with you today!

## Free Landing Page Template

First off, we would like to introduce you to the newest template in the Start Bootstrap line up, ‘Landing Page!’. This template is a bit different than some of our others. You might notice that it features some custom fonts and some custom, but subtle, colors. That being said, the motivation behind doing this was to make this template usable right out of the box, but simple enough to remain easily customizable.

To download this template for free, visit the preview page here: <http://startbootstrap.com/landing-page>.

## Flex Admin - Premium Admin Theme

Our second announcement for today is the release of our first premium template, 'Flex Admin.’ The popularity of our free admin theme gave us the idea to put something up on the WrapBootstrap theme store, and 'Flex Admin’ is how we did it.

The template is a very flexible theme with plenty of great plugins built-in along with a number of pre-designed example pages that are ready to be integrated into your next web application. Last, but not least, is one of the major features of this template: dedicated support. When purchasing 'Flex Admin,’ you will have access to dedicated email support, and we will be there to answer any questions you might have when working with the template.

You can purchase this premium template over at the WrapBootstrap theme store. Also, be sure to look for more items there by us in the future as well!

To purchase your copy of 'Flex Admin,’ visit the Flex Admin page on the WrapBootstrap theme store.
