I’ve finally gotten around to adding a full website template to the mix. This first full website template by Start Bootstrap features 17 different pages of content that is ready to customize.

The template includes a working PHP contact form, a Google Maps integrated contact page, and lots of great pages that make good use of Bootstrap’s JavaScript resources.

To get the template, simply visit <http://startbootstrap.com/modern-business> and preview the demo. If you like what you see, just download the .zip file. It’s free, it’s open source, and it is pre-packaged with all of the different assets that make it work including: Bootstrap 3, Font Awesome Icon Fonts, and jQuery.

We hope you enjoy this first template. It’s multi-purpose enough to use for anything really, and it’s pretty general. Next up in the lineup of full templates is going to be something a bit more artsy…perhaps something that would work well for a photography portfolio or something of the sort. We’ll see!

If you have any suggestions or feedback, drop us a line at feedback@startbootstrap.com and we’ll get back to you.

Thanks, and enjoy this new template!
